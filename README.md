# Sales-Return-Analysis
I analyze a dataset pertaining to returns for a manufacturing firm.

In particular, I utlize a large sample dataset with ~9,000 rows & 25 columns, containing information like SKU Number, Location,
Region, Time, Vendor, etc. 

The dataset was messy by design, including missing observations, broken columns headers, poorly formatted information, wrong datatypes, etc. 

The exact questions I was trying to answer are included in the Prompt/Assignment Text File. 

To answer the questions, I utilized a variety of Advanced Excel concepts like SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, Conditional Formatting, 
Power Query, LEFT, RIGHT, MONTH, YEAR, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, etc. 

I organized my analysis findings in a PowerPoint Presentation to present to business leaders & a non-technical audience. 

I later provided recommendations to the business based upon my analysis findings to prevent returns moving forward.
